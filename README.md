This repository contains a compilation of code, data, and visualizations associated with the paper "Biogeographic regions within Indomalaya: an integrated approach using bird distributions."
Authors: Zheng Oong, Sharon A. Jansa, Sushma Reddy

## R scripts ##
1. **01_IndomalayaBioregions_Dataset.R**: Dataset setup and filtering steps (including information about work done externally on ArcGIS and QGIS), plus presence-absence matrix generation with letsR.
2. **02_IndomalayaBioregions_NDM.R**: NDM input file generation and output management.
3. **03_IndomalayaBioregions_Ecostructure.R**: Ecostructure Grade of Membership model fitting, visualization of results as rasters, calculation of motif overlap, and network graph for motif stability.
4. **04_IndomalayaBioregions_hclust.R**: Hierarchical clustering algorithm selection, assessment of optimal cluster, visualization of cluster assignments on dendrogram and map.

## Data files ##
The 'data' directory contains the following files (listed alphabetically):
1. **any_indomalaya.csv**: A list of all 2827 species with any native and resident occurrence in Indomalaya. This list is the starting point for the area percentage filtering process in described in the script _01_IndomalayaBioregions_Dataset.R_.
2. **IM_Presab_XXdeg.csv**: Four presence-absence matrices generated at four spatial resolutions from the final dataset of 1544 study species. The end of the filenames indicate the spatial resolution of the matrix: 5deg, 2deg, 1deg, and halfdeg for 5째, 2째, 1째, and 0.5째 respectively. Rows are individual cells, while columns are the 1544 study species plus two additional ones for longitude (x) and latitude (y).
3. **motif_names_v4.csv**: A list of all motif names (plus three-letter abbreviations) from Ecostructure, plus a column containing a series of "graph index" for use in plotting the network graph tracking motif stability.

In addition, the 'data' directory contains the following subdirectories (listed alphabetically):
1. **base_maps**: Contains the Tropical Asia and Indomalaya maps (shapefile) used as base maps for plotting purposes.
2. **ecostructure_model_fits**: Contains all 19 model fit results (K = 2 to 20) from Ecostructure in RDS format.
3. **hclust**: Contains tables (.xlsx) detailing the cophenetic correlation coefficients calculated for algorithm selection, as well as the silhouette widths and matrix correlation values for selecting optimal number(s) of clusters; also contains image files (.png) showing the fusion level, silhouette widths, and matrix correlation values for selecting optimal clusters (based on guidelines in [Borcard et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-71404-2_4)).
